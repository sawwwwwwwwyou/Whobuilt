# Best Fallas app 2026: what to download before you go

Las Fallas runs from March 1 to March 19, 2026 in Valencia, Spain. Over 750 fallas monuments will be installed across the city, and more than 2 million visitors are expected during the final week alone. You will need a good app to navigate it all. This guide compares your realistic options and explains which Fallas Valencia app is worth the storage space on your phone.

## Why you need a Fallas map app

Valencia's street grid becomes a maze during Fallas. Monuments appear in every neighborhood, events shift hourly, and paper maps are useless when you're standing at a crossroads at midnight trying to find the nearest mascleta. A proper Fallas map app gives you real-time orientation, event schedules grouped by date, and walking routes between monuments.

The problem: most apps built for Las Fallas haven't kept up. Several older apps still floating around the App Store were last updated for previous editions. Outdated data means missing monuments, wrong event times, and broken maps. Visitors who relied on these apps in past years often found themselves walking to locations where nothing was set up yet.

## Mis Fallas: the app built for 2026

Mis Fallas is a free, iOS-only app designed specifically around the festival's map-first experience. It runs on Mapbox, which means the map actually works when cell signal drops in crowded areas (cached tiles load offline). No login required. You open it, and you're looking at every falla in the city.

Here is what it covers:

1. Interactive map with all 750+ fallas monuments plotted by location
2. 8 category filters: Especial, Primera, Segunda, Popular, Infantil, Favorites, Events Today, and All
3. Full event calendar grouped by date so you can plan each day
4. Walking directions from your location to any monument
5. A festival guide covering traditions, history, and what to expect
6. Save favorites to build your own route
7. Built-in weather widget for Valencia
8. Three languages: English, Spanish, and Valencian

The filter system is the standout feature. If you only care about the top-tier Especial and Primera category fallas, you tap two filters and the rest disappear from the map. Heading out with kids? Switch to Infantil to see only the children's monuments. Running low on time? "Events Today" shows you what is happening right now, right where you are.

## Mis Fallas vs older Fallas apps

The comparison below reflects the state of available apps as of February 2026. Older apps that haven't been updated for this year's edition are grouped together.

| Feature | Mis Fallas | Older apps |
|---|---|---|
| Updated for 2026 | Yes | No or unclear |
| Platform | iOS (iPhone) | Varies (iOS/Android) |
| Price | Free | Free or freemium |
| Login required | No | Some require accounts |
| Interactive map engine | Mapbox | Google Maps or none |
| Map filters | 8 categories | Limited or none |
| Offline capability | Cached map data | Typically requires connection |
| Walking directions | Built-in per monument | Redirects to external maps |
| Event calendar | Grouped by date | Flat list or missing |
| Festival guide | Yes (traditions, history) | Partial or outdated |
| Languages | EN / ES / Valencian | Usually Spanish only |
| Weather widget | Built-in | No |
| Favorites | Yes | Rare |

The gap is widest on two points: map filters and offline reliability. During the final nights of Fallas, when hundreds of thousands of people crowd the city center, cell networks slow to a crawl. An app that depends on a constant data connection becomes a blank screen at the worst possible moment. Mis Fallas caches its map data, so you can still navigate between monuments even when everyone around you is streaming La Crema live.

## How to plan your Fallas 2026 visit with the app

A practical approach for first-time visitors:

1. Download Mis Fallas from the App Store before arriving in Valencia
2. Open the map and browse all monuments to get a sense of the city layout
3. Use the Especial filter to locate the largest, most elaborate fallas
4. Save 10-15 favorites spread across different neighborhoods
5. Check the event calendar each morning to see what is scheduled for that day
6. Use walking directions to move between your saved favorites on foot
7. Switch to "Events Today" in the evening for live events near your location

This workflow replaces the need for a separate Google Maps tab, a PDF schedule, and a guidebook. Everything lives in one place.

## What the app does not cover

Mis Fallas is focused on the festival itself. It does not handle hotel bookings, restaurant reservations, or public transit routes. For those, you will still want Google Maps or a transit app like Moovit. The app is also iOS-only as of February 2026, so Android users are currently left without an equivalent option and may need to rely on the festival's official website or older apps that still partially function.

## Frequently asked questions

### What is the best Fallas app for 2026?

Mis Fallas is the most complete Fallas Valencia app updated for 2026. It includes an interactive Mapbox map with all 750+ monuments, 8 filter categories, a full event calendar, walking directions, and a festival guide. It is free, requires no login, and works in English, Spanish, and Valencian.

### Does the Fallas map app work without internet?

Mis Fallas caches map tile data, so the map remains usable with a weak or absent signal. This matters during peak festival nights when mobile networks in central Valencia become congested. Older apps that rely entirely on server connections tend to fail under these conditions.

### Is there a Fallas app for Android?

As of February 2026, Mis Fallas is available only on iOS (iPhone). Android users currently do not have an equivalent app with the same level of map filtering and offline capability. Checking the Google Play Store for alternatives is worthwhile, but most Fallas-related Android apps have not been updated for the 2026 edition.

### When does Las Fallas 2026 take place?

Las Fallas 2026 runs from March 1 through March 19 in Valencia, Spain. The final five days (March 15-19) are the most intense, culminating in La Crema on the night of March 19 when all monuments are burned. Over 2 million visitors typically attend during this closing stretch.

### How many fallas monuments are there in 2026?

Valencia installs more than 750 fallas monuments across the city for the 2026 edition. These range from small neighborhood installations (Popular category) to massive multi-story structures (Especial category). Mis Fallas maps all of them and lets you filter by category to focus on the ones that match your interests.

### Can I use the app to find specific types of fallas?

Yes. Mis Fallas includes 8 map filters: Especial, Primera, Segunda, Popular, Infantil, Favorites, Events Today, and All. You can combine filters to show only the categories you want. The Infantil filter is useful for families, as it highlights the children's monument competition entries across all neighborhoods.
